# This project was built by following the tutorial from LamaDev. The full tutorial can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIdNeoHniEY


## The Project

In this project, I created a simple registration form using the React framework. The app is a single page allowing users to enter their names, email, DOB. and password in order to register to an unnamed website. The app is not connected to any databases and is not hosted live, as the purpose was mainly for me to learn how to apply form validation techniques using react.

## Skills Acquired 

- improved fluency with react
- learned form validation using a combination of JSX elements and CSS

## How to set up the app

the first step requires setting up a react app. For this purpose I used the create-react-app by running "npx create-react-app simple-registration-form" in the terminal. You can then copy the code from this repository in the src folder and type "npm run start" to see the app in your browser.
